The only thing is that wouldn't you expect the first ""too long"" argument to mess up the sync with the argument list for the later argument? IOW, if the order is `*walker`, `*head` in the `printf` statement, shouldn't `*head` get messed up instead of, as it happens, `*walker` messing up and `head` getting the 1?","2018-01-01 02:27:50","","2812104"

When making complex and large-scale applications especially in Android you should always try to modularize your code. Firstly identify important function in your code to be performed and then write a function for each of the important actions. This enables reusability of your code too. Well, the debate on modularity can go on and on.
