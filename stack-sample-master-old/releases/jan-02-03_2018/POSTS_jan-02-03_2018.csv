<p>To do what you described, we need to have the pointer to A's <code>vtable</code>. Our object <code>p</code> has only pointer to B's <code>vtable</code>, so we need to store second pointer in a field within A's constructor.</p>

<p>Here is the code:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
struct A{
    virtual void foo() { std::cout &lt;&lt; ""A::foo()"" &lt;&lt; std::endl; }
    int *a_vtable_ptr;
    // First, save value of A's vtable pointer in a separate variable.
    A() { a_vtable_ptr = *(int**)this; }
};

struct B:A{
    virtual void foo() { std::cout &lt;&lt; ""B::foo()"" &lt;&lt; std::endl; }
    void callBase(void (A::*f)()){
        int *my_vtable_ptr = *(int**)this;
        // Then modify vtable pointer of given object to one that corresponds to class A.
        *(int**)this = a_vtable_ptr;
        (this-&gt;*f)(); // Call the method as usual.
        // Restore the original vtable pointer.
        *(int**)this = my_vtable_ptr;
    }
};

// Function main() is not modified.
int main(){
    B* p=new B();
    void (A::*f)() = &amp;A::foo;
    p-&gt;callBase(f);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every single object in a ClearCase VOB is referenced by its oid (""object ID"").<br>
  The oid is unique inside the VOB.<br>
  <strong>This does not apply only to file, but to all objects in the VOB.</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Element</li>
  <li>Version</li>
  <li>Metadata</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>ClearCase uses the oid internally. The oid is invisible for common user's operation. However, in some error messages, you see a reference to an oid. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To find the oid from an object, you use :</p>

<pre><code>cleartool dump &lt;object&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To find the object from an oid, you use :</p>

<pre><code>cleartool dump oid:&lt;object&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For theses commands to work, you need to be in a view and in the corresponding VOB. This is necessary in order to generate the path/file name.</p>

<p><code>&lt;object&gt;</code> can be anything defined as an object for ClearCase. Like for instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>element <code>&lt;file&gt;@@</code></li>
<li>version <code>&lt;file&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;file&gt;@@\main\......</code></li>
<li>type <code>lbtype:&lt;name&gt;</code></li>
<li>VOB or replica object <code>vob:&lt;vobtag&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You can also run ""<code>cleartool describe -long oid:&lt;oid&gt;</code>"" on the oid while set in a view to the root of the VOB to which the element resides, and the output will return an element name.<br>

<p>Determine today’s day-of-week.</p>

<p>Or get the following day-of-week.</p>

<pre><code>LocalDate nextOrSameDay = yearAgo.with( TemporalAdjusters.nextOrSame( dow ) ;

"48054276","2","","10318852","2018-01-02 00:06:30","","-1","","<p>I tried it, I loaded a 2nd tree into the same table.  On one hand, Django MPTT gave new tree_id's to the new tree branches.  So in that way, it seemed to work.  On the other hand, now the names of the nodes do NOT show up using the template from the Django MPTT site. (I attach a screen shot.) The template worked perfectly when there was only one tree in the table.  I made no change to any code and such, I just put a 2nd tree in the table, and presto! no names on the listing.<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LLj7h.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LLj7h.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The structure of the tree looks the same.  I also get no names when I access the other tree, which I can access OK, except there are no names.</p>

<p>Here is the model definition:</p>

<pre><code>class EbayCategory(MPTTModel):
    iCategoryID     = models.PositiveIntegerField( 'ebay category number',
                        db_index=True )
    name            = models.CharField(
                        'ebay category description', max_length = 50 )
    iLevel          = models.PositiveSmallIntegerField(
                        'ebay level (top is 1, lower levels are bigger numbers)' )
    iParentID       = models.PositiveIntegerField( 'ebay parent category' )
    bLeafCategory   = models.BooleanField( 'leaf category?' )
    iTreeVersion    = models.PositiveSmallIntegerField( 
                        'category tree version' )
    iMarket         = models.ForeignKey( Market, verbose_name = 'ebay market' )
    iSupercededBy   = models.PositiveIntegerField(
                        'superceded by this ebay category', null = True )
    parent          = TreeForeignKey( 'self',
                        null=True, blank=True, related_name='children',
                        db_index=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

    class Meta():
        verbose_name_plural = 'ebay categories'
        db_table        = 'ebay_categories'
        unique_together = ('iCategoryID', 'iMarket',)

    class MPTTMeta:
        order_insertion_by = ['name']
</code></pre>

<p>All the columns except parent come in from the ebay API.</p>

<p>At this point, I have no categories that have been superceded, so the iSupercededBy column is null for all rows. I have not experienced an ebay catetory list update yet, so all the rows for each market are the same ebay tree version (the current one).</p>

<p>The view selects by market and ebay tree version (both values come from the Markets table):</p>

<pre><code>def show_ebay_categories(request, sMarket):
    iMarket = Market.objects.get( cMarket = sMarket.upper() )
    context = { 'nodes':EbayCategory.objects.filter(
        iMarket = iMarket, iTreeVersion = iMarket.iCategoryVer ) }
    return render(request, 'ebaycategories/ebay_categories.html', context)
</code></pre>

<p>Running the same code, against a copy of the database from before adding in the 2nd tree, the names show up.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dWd2q.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dWd2q.png"" alt=""ebay categories -- today, using database copy before adding 2nd tree""></a></p>

<p>It seem adding the 2nd tree corrupted the table in a way that rebuild cannot fix.  I deleted the 2nd tree.  Still no names.  I rebuilt the tree:</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5541432/how-do-i-rebuild-my-django-mptt-tree"">How do I rebuild my django-mptt tree?</a></p>

<p>Still no names. I truncated the table, then re-uploaded the first tree (ebay USA categories).  Still no names.  I rebuilt the tree again.  Still no names.</p>

<p>What worked:  Adding a root node to each category listing (tree) when importing the data. (The data downloaded from ebay did not include a root node,)</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eA1A2.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eA1A2.png"" alt=""ebay categories with root node""></a></p>

<p>Note ""EBAY-US version 117 Root"" at the top of the listing.</p>

<p>I generated the listing AFTER importing into the same table a 2nd tree. So yes it can work.</p>

You could start with something like this: <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API</a>.</p>

<p>It's unclear exactly what you're asking, though.  How exactly do you want this div to appear - rendered somewhere on the page after clicking the button, then later dragged, or immediately in a dragging state, or something else?</p>

<p>The drag/drop API will support both of what I described above, but getting each to work requires different approaches.  Clarification here would help.</p>

<p>My question simply, is akka really a solution for a deadlock.</p>

<p>I know as long as akka actors treat objects as completely decoupled, that code never meets a deadlock scenario. But, in the imperative programming also we can simply decouple them and lock separately without keeping a lock inside another lock, so that won't be a deadlock scenario at all in traditional programming paradigm also. what's the real use case of this statement? Do we find any use case, which can cause deadlock scenario in traditional programming but prevent using akka actor model?</p>

<p>P.S I am very new to akka but, I can understand the call stack, shared memory and threading issues in traditional programming is very costly in the modern computer architecture and akka is a good solution in performance-wise. But curious to know this special statement also.</p>

Each file is saved in the same directory, and there is a numerical sequence in the naming scheme so the order of the database is maintained. Ive done this to reduce the time and memory it takes to load and manipulate the database. I would like to start analyzing the database in sequence, which I intend to accomplish using a rollapply like function. I am having a problem when I want the window to span two files at once. Which is where I need help. Here is dummy dataset that will create five CSV files with a similar naming scheme to my database:</p>

<pre><code>library(readr)

val &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5)
df_1 &lt;- data.frame(val)

write_csv(df_1, ""1_database.csv"", col_names = TRUE)
write_csv(df_1, ""2_database.csv"", col_names = TRUE)
write_csv(df_1, ""3_database.csv"", col_names = TRUE)
write_csv(df_1, ""4_database.csv"", col_names = TRUE)
write_csv(df_1, ""5_database.csv"", col_names = TRUE)
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind that this database is huge, and causes memory and time issues on my current machine. The solution MUST have a component that ""forgets"". This means recurrently joining the files, or loading them all at once to the R environment is not an option. When a new file is loaded, the last file must be removed from the R environment. I can have at maximum three files loaded at once. For example files 1-3 can be loaded, and then file 1 needs to be removed before file 4 is loaded. </p>

<p>The output can be a single list of all files - the combination of files 1-5 in a single list.</p>

<p>For the sake of simplicity, lets say I want to use a window of 2, and I want to calculate the mean of this window. I'm imagining something like this (see below) but this maybe a failed approach, and I'm open to anything.</p>

<pre><code>appreciated_function &lt;- function(x){

<p>Just so that you know: my webpack config uses multiple modules, with multiple (6) entry points, so this is a cut-down sample of my <code>webpack.config.js</code>:</p>

<pre><code>{
context: path.join(__dirname, 'src'),
entry: {
    'js/contentscript.js' : './js/contentscript.js',
    'js/background.js'    : './js/background.js',
    'js/popup.js'         : './js/popup.js',

},

    path: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),

},

    new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({
        name: ""dexie"",
        filename: ""js/dexie.js"",
        minChunks: function (module) {
            // this assumes your vendor imports exist in the node_modules directory
            return module.context &amp;&amp; module.context.includes(""node_modules/dexie"");
        }
    }),
    ... // other non relevant plugins here
]
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that I have no typical 'vendor' nor 'common' requirement, like many other projects to. It's <em>only</em> in a few cases that I want to include the <code>js/dexie.js</code> bundle. </p>

<p>eg. in <code>options.html</code>, I have this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""js/dexie.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=""js/options.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>...but I do not want it to be used for <code>popup.html</code>, which I want to keep as this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""js/popup.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And since this is also a WebExtensions project, I <em>definitely</em> don't want my content scripts to need it!</p>

<p>The problem is, that when I open popup.js, I get the error: <code>Uncaught ReferenceError: webpackJsonp is not defined</code>.</p>

<p>Is there any way  -- <em>without splitting this into more webpack modules</em> -- so that the <code>CommonsChunkPlugin</code> will play nice with the entry points so that only the ones I want are affected by it? </p>

<p>The only solution I can think of, is to make another <code>CommonsChunkPlugin</code> that acts in the way that 'vendor' and 'common' is typically used. That is:</p>

<pre><code>    new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({
        name: ""dexie"",
        filename: ""js/dexie.js"",
        minChunks: function (module) {
            // this assumes your vendor imports exist in the node_modules directory
            return module.context &amp;&amp; module.context.includes(""node_modules/dexie"");
        }
    }),
    new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({
        name: ""manifest"",
        filename: ""js/manifest.js"",
        minChunks: Infinity
    }),
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, this means I need to include <code>js/manifest.js</code> in <em>all</em> my scripts, and since this is a WebExtension, then that means I have to inject it into each content page...IMHO this is a terrible solution.</p>

<p>Any ideas on how to improve this? Am I using <code>CommonsChunkPlugin</code> incorrectly? Is there a better module I should be using? (I'm actually still coming to grips with webpack!)</p>

<p>An Observable is a data stream. If you setup multiple subscriptions to the same API call in your service, when new data is pulled from the API every subscription will get the new values. The problem is that HTTP Requests are just that, 'requests' that originate from the client.</p>

This is usually done by chaining a bunch of <code>.then()</code> calls/blocks together. Remember, the <code>then()</code> portion will only be called when a Promise resolves.</p>

<p>In your case, it looks like you can just generate <code>balanceresponse</code> and call the <code>response.send()</code> after you calculate <code>workingbalance</code>, inside the same block of code. The call to <code>response.send()</code> doesn't need to be at the end of the function. So you might have that block look something like:</p>

<pre><code>.then(snapshot =&gt; {
    var workingbalance = 0
    snapshot.forEach(doc =&gt; {
        workingbalance = workingbalance + doc.data().amount;

      ""source"": ""system""
    }

    response.send(balanceresponse); 
})

<p>If, for some reason, you wanted to separate the calculation and compute the <code>balanceresponse</code> in a different block, you could do so. I don't necessarily recommend this, but it has some merits (for example, you could put multiple catch blocks after each part, which I've shown here):</p>
