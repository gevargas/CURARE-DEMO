As for checking irreducibility, there are several options: (1) no checking; leave it to the user, noting that using a non-irreducible polynomial will lead to errors (such as elements not having inverses), (2) download, or provide online access to, a library of known polynomials - since most finite fields are ""small"" this may work, with the proviso that polynomials not in this library devolve to option (1), and (3) code up a criterion such as given at https://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~brent/pd/ANZMC08t4.pdf","2018-01-03 00:26:28","","1568590"

In this case, a function defined in a library (ideally one that's already written).  Some things can never be concise unless you add abstraction. Adding abstraction adds some overhead, so if you are avoiding typing something out only 2 or 3 times, it's not such a good deal.  But if you are doing `is_empty` checks all over the place, it is a huge win to simplify all your checks AND keep them consistent at the same time.","2018-01-03 00:27:34","","59135"

In this scenario, client direct access to 5601 should be denied.  3. The custom header option is more complicated than the other options.
