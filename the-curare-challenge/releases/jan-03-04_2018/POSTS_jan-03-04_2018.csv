<p>Secondly this is somewhat crude method but works. 
Solution is you first allocate memory using whatever means u can. Then use reinterpret_cast to cast pointer to that memory location as pointer to your class.
Lastly have empty constructor and move all the work done inside constructor to initialize method.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

class A
{
    public:
    A() {;}
    /* This is not replacement for constructor as constructor
    also constructs virtual table calls base class constructor
    so do not add virtual method and base classes here.*/
    void initialize() 
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; ""Inside Intialize"" &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
};

int main()
{
    try
    {
        char arr[2048];
        void* ptr = arr;
        A* classptr = reinterpret_cast&lt;A*&gt;(ptr);
        classptr-&gt;initialize();
    }
    catch(...)

<p>Sometimes the solution will build and run fine, but if only make a code change in one of the projects referencing S.W.I 4.0.0.0 then I get a runtime error along the lines of ""v4.5.0.0 could not be found"". v4.0.0.0 is being copied to the build output folder but my binding redirect is telling it to expect 4.5.0.0.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on a solution? I <em>could</em> try uninstalling and reinstalling the packages in the projects causing the issue, to see if I can get them to reference the 4.5.0.0 in the MahApps package, but my concern is that this may not be guaranteed to work during a package restore, screwing it up for another developer (or the build server).</p>

<h1>Second</h1>

<p>The order you declare duplicated properties is important.</p>

<p>If the color you want to be applied is <code>green</code> this is not the same:   </p>

<pre><code>// correct way to declare fallback color, it will be green and yellow if --color3 was not defined
body span {
  --color3: green;
  color: yellow;
  color: var(--color3);
}
</code></pre>

<p>as:    </p>

<pre><code>body span { // incorrect way to declare fallback color
  --color3: green;
  color: var(--color3);
  color: yellow;
  color: var(--color4);
}
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>The property <code>color: var(--color4);</code> will be taken since there is no invalid syntax on this declaration but since there is no variable declared as <code>--color4</code> the inherited color will be applied (<em>in this case from <code>body { color: var(--color1) }</code></em>)    </p>
  
  <p>Because <code>color</code> <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color#Syntax"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">is a inherited property</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><br></p>

<h1>Third</h1>

<p>Using the fallback with <code>var()</code> is another solution, but the previous one is a fallback for older browsers that don't support <code>var()</code>    </p>

<p>Furthermore, you are using it wrong, the correct way to use the fallback from <code>var()</code> should be this:</p>

<pre><code>color: var(--color4, var(--color3));
</code></pre>

<p>or this:   </p>

<pre><code>color: var(--color4, var(--color3, yellow));
</code></pre>

<p><code>var()</code> only accepts 2 arguments, the value you want to use and the fallback.<br>
See the syntax of how to use it in the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/var#Syntax"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">following link</a></p>

<p><br></p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Since <code>var()</code> is not available in all browsers <em>yet</em>, using duplicated properties the right way is the option I would go with, or you can go with both of them.</p>

One of GraphQL's selling points is ""fetch less and more at once"". A client can decide very granually what it needs from the backend. Using deeply nested graphlike queries that previously required multiple endpoints can now be expressed in a single query. At the same time over-fetching can be avoided. Now you find yourself with a big query, everything loads at once and there are no n+1 query waterfalls. But now you know that a few fields in your big query are subject to change from now and then and you want to actively update the cache with new data from the server. Apollo offers the <code>refetch</code> field but it loads the whole query which clearly is <em>overfetching</em> that was sold to me as not being a concern anymore in GraphQL. Let me offer some solutions:</p>

<h2>Premature Optimisation?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time worrying about efficiency in the wrong places and at the wrong times; premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming. <strong>- Donald Knuth</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes we try to optimise too much without measuring first. Write it the easy way first and then see if it is really an issue. What exactly is slow? The network? A particular field in the query? The sheer size of the query?</p>

<p>After you analized what exactly is slow we can start looking into improving:</p>

<h2>Refetch and include/skip directives</h2>

<p>Using <a href=""http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#directives"" rel=""noreferrer"">directives</a> you can exclude fields from a query depending on variables. The <a href=""https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/basics/queries.html#graphql-query-data-refetch"" rel=""noreferrer"">refetch function can specify different variables</a> than the initial query. This way you can exclude fields when you refetch the query.</p>

<h2>Splitting up Queries</h2>

<p>Single page apps are a great idea. The HTML is generated client side and the page does not have to make expensive trips to the server to render a new page. But soon SPAs got to big and code splitting became an issue. And now we are basically back to server side rendering and splitting the app into pages. The same might apply to GraphQL. Sometimes queries are too big and should be split. You could split up the queries for <code>UserInfo</code> and <code>ListOfFriends</code>. Inside of the cache the fields will be merged. With <a href=""https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/query-batching-in-apollo-63acfd859862"" rel=""noreferrer"">query batching</a> both queries will be send in the same request and a GraphQL server that implements per request resource caching correctly (e.g. with <a href=""https://github.com/facebook/dataloader"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dataloader</a>) will barely notice a difference.</p>

<h2>Subscriptions</h2>

<p>Maybe you are ready to use subscriptions already. Subscriptions send updates from the server for fields that have changed. This way you could subscribe to a user's friends and get updates in real time. The good news is that Apollo Client, Relay and many server implementations offer support for subscriptions already. The bad news is that it needs websockets that usually put different requirements on your technology stack than pure HTTP.</p>

<h2><code>withApollo()</code> -> <code>this.client.query</code></h2>

<p>This should only be your last resort! Using <a href=""https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo"" rel=""noreferrer"">react-apollo</a>'s <code>withApollo</code> higher order component you can directly inject the <code>ApolloClient</code> instance. You can now execute queries using <code>this.client.query()</code>. <code>{ user(id: 1) { friendlist { ... } } }</code> can be used to just fetch the friend list and update the cache which will lead to an update of your component. This might look like what you want but can haunt you in later stages of the app.</p>

So, why doesn't that work for lists and dictionaries? Well, if you have a piece of code like this:</p>

<pre><code>static string Test()
{
   Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt; s = new Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;();
   return s[0];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This (in debug mode) translates to this IL code:</p>

<pre><code>IL_0000: nop
IL_0001: newobj instance void class [mscorlib]System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2&lt;int32, string&gt;::.ctor()
IL_0006: stloc.0
IL_0007: ldloc.0
IL_0008: ldc.i4.0
IL_0009: callvirt instance !1 class [mscorlib]System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2&lt;int32, string&gt;::get_Item(!0)
IL_000e: stloc.1
IL_000f: br.s IL_0011

IL_0011: ldloc.1
IL_0012: ret
</code></pre>

<p>This, in turn means that what you do with one line of code (<code>return s[0]</code>) is actually a three-step process: calling the method, storing the return value in a local variable and then returning the value that is stored in that local variable. And, as pointed out by the links the others have provided, returning a local variable by reference is not possible (unless the local variable is a ref local variable, but as pointed out by the others again, since <code>Diciotionary&lt;TKey,TValue&gt;</code> and <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> does not have a by-reference return API, this is not possible either). </p>

<p>And now, why does it work for the array? If you look at how array-indexing is handled more closely (i.e. on IL-code level), you can see that there is no method call for array indexing. Instead, a special opcode is added to the code called ldelem (or some variant of that). A code like this: </p>

<pre><code> static string Test()
 {
    string[] s = new string[2];
    return s[0];
 }
</code></pre>

<p>translates to this in IL:</p>

<pre><code>IL_0000: nop
IL_0001: ldc.i4.2
IL_0002: newarr [mscorlib]System.String
IL_0007: stloc.0
IL_0008: ldloc.0
IL_0009: ldc.i4.0
IL_000a: ldelem.ref
IL_000b: stloc.1
IL_000c: br.s IL_000e

IL_000e: ldloc.1
IL_000f: ret
</code></pre>

<p>Of course this looks like the same as it was for the dictionary, but I think the key difference is that the indexer here generates an IL-native call, not a property (i.e. method) call. And if you look at all the possible ldelem variants on MSDN <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.emit.opcodes(v=vs.110).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, you can see that there is one called <strong>ldelema</strong> which can load the address of the element directly to the heap. And indeed, if you write a piece of code like this:</p>

<pre><code>static ref string Test()
{
   string[] s = new string[2];
   return ref s[0];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This translates to the following IL code, utilizing the direct-reference loading ldelema opcode:</p>

<pre><code>IL_0000: nop
IL_0001: ldc.i4.2
IL_0002: newarr [mscorlib]System.String
IL_0007: stloc.0
IL_0008: ldloc.0
IL_0009: ldc.i4.0
IL_000a: ldelema [mscorlib]System.String
IL_000f: stloc.1
IL_0010: br.s IL_0012

IL_0012: ldloc.1
IL_0013: ret
</code></pre>

<p>So basically, array indexers are different and under the hood, arrays have support for loading an element by reference to the evaluation stack via native IL calls. Since the <code>Dictionary&lt;TKey,TValue&gt;</code> and other collections implement indexers as properties, which result in method calls, they can only do this if the method called explicitly specifies ref returns.</p>

There are text messages hidden in these images, using steganographic algorithm. If an image has been edited, before the user has read the message, a warning should pop out. Now, my idea is that, before one user sends the image to another, a the image gets hashed and stored as a value into the receiver's HashMap. Key to the hash value is the path to that image. </p>

<p>When the user receives the image, before the decryption, they first need to hash the selected image, then compare the hash of that image, with the hash previously added to their HashMap. Here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>public String hashTheImage(byte[] image) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
    MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(""SHA-256"");
    return byteArray2Hex(md.digest(image));
}

private static String byteArray2Hex(final byte[] hash) {
    Formatter formatter = new Formatter();
    for (byte b : hash) {
        formatter.format(""%02x"", b);
    }
    return formatter.toString();
}
</code></pre>

<p>These methods hash the image. Then I do the following:</p>

<pre><code>receiver.getMap().put(image.getPath(), this.hashTheImage(imageBytes));
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this is my method where I am trying to check if the two hashes are equal:</p>

<pre><code>private boolean checkForChanges(String path, String newlyGeneratedHash){
    String receiverHash = receiver.getMap().get(path);
    if(!newlyGeneratedHash.equals(receiverHash)){
        JFrame frame = new JFrame();
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(frame, ""Image has been edited!"", 
            ""ERROR!"", JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE);
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here I get that the receiverHash is null. I know that I am supposed to override hashCode() and equals() method, but I am not sure how, since I only need it for Strings. 
If anyone can give me an idea, I would really appreciate it. Please don't be rude, comment only if you can and want to help. Thanks</p>

<p>The name you are seeing is probably the random hex name assigned to a copy of the original installation database that is cached on the system in <code>%SystemRoot%\Installer</code> (normally C:\WINDOWS\Installer). This is a ""super hidden"" OS folder, and it should never be touched in any way at all.</p>

<p>A sample path to such a database could be: <code>C:\WINDOWS\Installer\7da655.msi</code>. I am pretty sure this is what you are seeing in your UAC prompt. Please verify or better yet add a picture of it to your question for other people's reference.</p>

<p>This cached database, with the weird name, is used during modify, repair and uninstall operations for the software in question. What WiX is showing you is in every way the correct information - it is what a system administrator might even need to see at some point. However, other setup creation tools do things differently, often showing the vendor and the product GUID instead of the full path to the cached database.</p>

<p>So that was the explanation - now we have to wait for one of the WiX guys to actually answer whether it is possible to change this display type. As such this is more of a comment than an answer, but it should be relevant to understand what is going on. I am also going to have a look now to see if I see any options to change this in WiX.</p>

<p>In my personal opinon the WiX display is superior to some of the other UAC dialogs shown for other MSI files, but I realize you find this information too detailed for your users. I suppose they could hide this path in the ""more information"" section.</p>

<p>So, I'm trying to write this stored procedure which selects from a table without actual table name (I'm trying to pass table name from input to stored procedure) here is my stored procedure:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE PROCEDURE test

    set { link = value; }
}

<p>and this is how I defined <code>linksg</code> in a function (my <code>search_sitedomain</code> function takes a domain like .com and gives a link to a table which includes your sitename like .com table):</p>

<pre><code>public void search_sitedomain()

<p>The list has the basic structure: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""main_list""&gt;
    &lt;li class&gt;
        &lt;a data-item_number_id=""555000"" class=""item""  &lt;span id=""displayname""&gt;greyblackhammer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;li class&gt;
        &lt;a data-item_number_id=""555004"" class=""item""  &lt;span id=""displayname""&gt;red_orangehammer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>With thousands of entries. </p>

<p>Let's say I have:</p>

<pre><code>var list_of_words = [""Green"", ""black"", ""other_words""]
</code></pre>

<p>I want to be able to search through the list of span ids (they can contain any mixture of spaces, upper and lowercase, underscores, etc), and, if they contain any of the strings in my list of words, add a ""starred"" class to their parent, so - in this example it would be: </p>

<pre><code> &lt;div id=""main_list""&gt;
    &lt;li class =""starred""&gt;
        &lt;a data-item_number_id=""555000"" class=""item""  &lt;span id=""displayname""&gt;greyblackhammer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;li class=""starred""&gt;
        &lt;a data-item_number_id=""555002"" class=""item""  &lt;span id=""displayname""&gt;grey_green_hammer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;li class&gt;
        &lt;a data-item_number_id=""555002"" class=""item""  &lt;span id=""displayname""&gt;red_orangehammer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So, case doesn't matter, spacing doesn't matter - just whether or not the span id contains the desired string in some way. </p>

<p>I'm not that familiar with jQuery, so I haven't gotten very far. Here's what I have: </p>

<pre><code> ids_to_star = [""Green"", ""black""];

 function star_matching_span_ids(){

var matching_ids = $('#main_list').find(""div:contains(ids_to_star)"");
   $.each(matching_ids, function (){
       $(this).parent('li').addClass('starred');
   });
}

<p>Now lets see about index in idb - </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An index is a specialized object store for looking up records in
  another object store, called the referenced object store. The index is
  a persistent key-value storage where the value part of its records is
  the key part of a record in the referenced object store. The records
  in an index are automatically populated whenever records in the
  referenced object store are inserted, updated, or deleted. Each record
  in an index can point to only one record in its referenced object
  store, but several indexes can reference the same object store. When
  the object store changes, all indexes that refer to the object store
  are automatically updated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So basically when you add index on a key, an special object store is maintained by indexeddb in order to search the records.</p>

<p>When you define column in JsStore - JsStore automatically add the index on that column, so that we can search on that column.</p>

<p>So the data is not repeated in columns and tables. The column is just referencing to the respective primary key , and using primary key it can access the actual stored value. The browser is only showing relationship between data.  </p>

<p>Hope this will give you more info about indexeddb columns, index and how they are stored.</p>

Unfortunately, Jenkins picks the wrong module as working directory. </p>

<p>In this particular case, I could change the order of the modules, but in general (more than one analyzed module) it is not working. So I want to fix the problem with the property <code>sonar.projectBaseDir</code>, see <a href=""https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Advanced+SonarQube+Scanner+Usages"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Advanced SonarQube Scanner Usages</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Alternate Analysis Directory</h2>
  
  <p>If the files to be analyzed are not in the directory where the analysis starts from, use the <code>sonar.projectBaseDir</code> property to move analysis to a different directory. E.G. analysis begins from <code>jenkins/jobs/myjob/workspace</code> but the files to be analyzed are in <code>ftpdrop/cobol/project1</code>.</p>
  
  <p><strong>sonar-project.properties</strong></p>
  
  <p>sonar.projectBaseDir=/home/ftpdrop/cobol/project1<br>
  sonar.sources=src<br>
  sonar.cobol.copy.directories=/copy  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tried following ways to set the <code>sonar.projectBaseDir</code> property to right module (<code>module2</code> instead of <code>module1</code>):</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>sonar.projectBaseDir</code> in <code>sonar-project.properties</code> file</p>

<p>But it doesn't work. The property in <code>sonar-project.properties</code> file is ignored. The log shows that the property is overriden with JVM option:</p>

<p></p>

<pre><code>/Users/test/jenkinsslave/tools/hudson.plugins.sonar.SonarRunnerInstallation/SonarQube_Scanner_2.8/bin/sonar-scanner -X -e -Dsonar.host.url=http://sonarqube:9090 -Dproject.settings=/Users/test/jenkinsslave/workspace/Test/module2/sonar-project.properties -Dsonar.projectBaseDir=/Users/test/jenkinsslave/workspace/Test/module1
</code></pre>

<p>I think that is a bug in  SonarQube Scanner plug-in, because <code>project.settings</code> is incompatible with  <code>sonar.projectBaseDir</code>, see <a href=""https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Advanced+SonarQube+Scanner+Usages"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Advanced SonarQube Scanner Usages</a>:</p>

That's a very inefficient way to build up a tree -- it's better to just call <a href=""https://gojs.net/latest/api/symbols/Model.html#addNodeData"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Model.addNodeData</a> with each new node data object.</p>

<p>If there is a data Binding in your node template that depends on the ""share"" data property, then you can modify a node by calling <a href=""https://gojs.net/latest/api/symbols/Model.html#setDataProperty"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Model.setDataProperty</a>:</p>

<pre><code>myDiagram.model.setDataProperty(someItem, ""share"", 17);

"48080869","2","","48044670","2018-01-03 16:00:15","","6","","<p>Those aren't great tutorials for the latest versions of <code>gensim</code>. In particular, it's a bad idea to be calling <code>train()</code> multiple times in a loop with your own manual management of <code>alpha</code>/<code>min_alpha</code>. It's easy to mess up – the wrong things will happen in your code, for example – and offers no benefit for most users. Don't change <code>min_alpha</code> from the default, and call <code>train()</code> exactly once – it'll then do exactly <code>epochs</code> iterations, decaying the learning-rate <code>alpha</code> from its max to min values properly. </p>

<p>Your specific error is because your <code>TaggedLineSentence</code> class doesn't have a <code>sentences</code> property – at least not until after <code>to_array()</code> is called – and yet the code is trying to access that non-existent property. </p>

<p>The whole <code>to_array()</code>/<code>sentences_perm()</code> approach is a bit broken. The reason for using such an iterable class is typically to keep a large dataset out of main-memory, streaming it from disk. But <code>to_array()</code> then just loads everything, caching it <em>inside</em> the class - eliminating the iterable benefit. If you can afford that, because the full dataset easily fits in memory, you can just do...</p>

<pre><code>sentences = list(TaggedLineSentence(sources)
</code></pre>

<p>...to iterate-from-disk once, then keep the corpus in an in-memory list. </p>

<p>And shuffling repeatedly during training isn't usually needed. Only if the training data has some existing clumping – like all the examples with certain words/topics are stuck together at the top or bottom of the ordering – is the native ordering likely to cause training problems. And in that case, a single shuffle, before any training, should be enough to remove the clumping. So again assuming your data fits in memory, you can just do...</p>

<pre><code>sentences = random.shuffle(list(TaggedLineSentence(sources)
</code></pre>

<p>...once, then you've got a <code>sentences</code> that's fine to pass to <code>Doc2Vec</code> in both <code>build_vocab()</code> and <code>train()</code> (once) below. </p>

<p>If you use <code>ChromeDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();</code> the <em>ChromeDriver</em> instance which will get created through that we will be only able to invoke and act on the methods implemented by <em>ChromeDriver</em> and supported by <em>Chrome Browser</em> only. To act with other browsers we have to specifically create individual objects as below :</p>

<ul>
<li><code>FirefoxDriver driver =  new FirefoxDriver();</code></li>
<li><code>InternetExplorerDriver driver = new InternetExplorerDriver();</code></li>
</ul>

<h2><code>WebDriver Interface</code></h2>

<p>From <em>Selenium</em> perspective, the <strong>WebDriver Interface</strong> is similar like a agreement which the 3rd party <em>Browser Vendors</em> like <em>Mozilla</em>, <em>Chrome</em>, <em>Internet Explorer</em>, <em>Safari</em>, etc have to adhere and implement the same. This would in-turn help the end-users to use the exposed APIs to write a common code and implement the functionalities across all the available <code>Browsers</code> without any change.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Why <code>WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();</code></h2>

<p>Through <code>WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();</code> we are creating an instance of the <em>WebDriver</em> interface and <strong>casting</strong> it to <strong>ChromeDriver Class</strong>. All the <em>Browser Drivers</em> like <a href=""https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/firefox/FirefoxDriver.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FirefoxDriver</a>, <a href=""https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/chrome/ChromeDriver.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ChromeDriver</a>, <a href=""https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/ie/InternetExplorerDriver.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">InternetExplorerDriver</a>, <a href=""http://phantomjs.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PhantomJSDriver</a>, <a href=""https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/safari/SafariDriver.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SafariDriver</a> etc implemented the <a href=""https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebDriver.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WebDriver</a> interface (actually the <a href=""https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/remote/RemoteWebDriver.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RemoteWebDriver</a> class implements <strong>WebDriver Interface</strong> and the <em>Browser Drivers</em> extends <strong>RemoteWebDriver</strong>). So if we use <code>WebDriver driver</code>, then we can use the already initialized <strong>driver</strong> (as common object variable) for all browsers we want to automate e.g. Mozilla, Chrome, InternetExplorer, PhantomJS, Safari.</p>

<pre><code>WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
driver = new ChromeDriver();
driver = new FirefoxDriver();
driver = new SafariDriver();
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Trivia <code>WebDriver Interface</code></h2>

<p>As per current scenario, we have to instantiate the implementations of <strong>WebDriver Interface</strong> directly. As per the current practice we write our <em>Automated Test Script</em> against this interface so that in future we may <strong>swap in</strong> a more fully featured <em>Browser</em> when there is a requirement for one.</p>

<p>I'm trying to write a function that will allow the user of the function to define a certain type using <em>no typescript type assertions</em> (just plain old javascript syntax). Basically, I'm trying to write something like React's PropTypes but I want to map the type defined with these ""PropTypes"" to a type that can be enforced with typescript.</p>

<p>Maybe it's easier to understand what I'm trying to do by seeing the code. Below <code>defineFunction</code> is a function that returns a function that takes in an object defined by ""PropTypes""`.</p>

<pre><code>interface PropType&lt;T&gt; { isOptional: PropType&lt;T | undefined&gt; }
type V&lt;Props&gt; = {[K in keyof Props]: PropType&lt;Props[K]&gt;};
interface PropTypes {
  string: PropType&lt;string&gt;,
  number: PropType&lt;number&gt;,
  bool: PropType&lt;boolean&gt;,
  shape: &lt;R&gt;(definer: (types: PropTypes) =&gt; V&lt;R&gt;) =&gt; PropType&lt;R&gt;
}

// the only purpose of this function is to capture the type and map it appropriately
// it does do anything else
function defineFunction&lt;Props, R&gt;(props: (types: PropTypes) =&gt; V&lt;Props&gt;, func: (prop: Props) =&gt; R) {
  return func;
}

// define a function
const myFunction = defineFunction(
  // this is the interface definition that will be mapped
  // to the actual required props of the function
  types =&gt; ({
    stringParam: types.string,
    optionalNumberParam: types.number.isOptional,
    objectParam: types.shape(types =&gt; ({
      nestedParam: types.string,
    }))
  }),
  // this is the function definition. the type of `props`
  // is the result of the mapped type above
  props =&gt; {
    props.objectParam.nestedParam
    return props.stringParam;
  }
);

// use function
myFunction({
  stringParam: '',
  optionalNumberParam: 0,
  objectParam: {
    nestedParam: ''
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the resulting type of <code>myFunction</code> found by hovering over the type in VS Code:</p>

<pre><code>const myFunction: (prop: {
    stringParam: string;
    optionalNumberParam: number | undefined;
    objectParam: {
        nestedParam: string;
    };
}) =&gt; string
</code></pre>

<h1>Question:</h1>

<p>There is an issue with the code above--<code>optionalNumberParam</code> is correctly defined as <code>number | undefined</code> but it is not actually optional!</p>

<p>If I omit the <code>optionalNumberParam</code>, the typescript compiler will yell at me.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rNbOQ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rNbOQ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<h3>Is there anyway to assert that a type is optional instead of just <code>T | undefined</code>?</h3>

<hr>

<p>Replying to <code>cale_b</code>'s comment: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just a thought - have you tried optionalNumberParam?: types.number.isOptional</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes and it's invalid syntax:</p>

<p>And to clarify, this <code>defineFunction</code> should let the user define a type using <em>no typescript type assertions</em>--instead everything should be inferred using mapped types. The <code>?</code> is typescript only. I'm trying to write this function so that--theoretically--javascript users could define proptypes and still have the typescript compiler enforce those proptypes.</p>

<p>I have created a test database which is a copy of my development database (both MySQL) but suspect that PHPUnit is not pointed to that database correctly.  I have the following line in my phpunit.xml already:</p>

<p>The test database should have all the tables set up already (I have already verified this via the console). Is there something else I need to do to point PHPUnit correctly? </p>

<p>For reference I wrote the tests using Symfony's KernelTestCase so my tests extend the Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Test\KernelTestCase class.</p>

<p>DESIRE:</p>

<p>I want the code to output the username corresponding in the .txt file based on the name inputted, so for example, if you inputted <code>'admin'</code> it would find text in the text document that starts with <code>admin</code> and find its ending which is always a <code>'0'</code> and output <code>admin010</code>. However, I want it to make sure, when you type <code>admin01</code> it would output <code>admin01030</code>. So the usernames are in the form, <code>name + value</code> (2 digits i.e. a value of 7 would be 07) <code>+ a zero</code> (<code>'0'</code> string).</p>

<p>PROBLEM:</p>

<p>The code isn't working, no matter my input it always outputs the last word in the .txt document. I'm not sure why, any help would be great.</p>

<h3>Continuous Integration Approach</h3>

<p>Swagger code generator simplifies maintenance because it allows you to think in terms of <em>continuous integrations</em>.</p>

<p>You should not be worried about code review or aesthetics (because it is a machine generated code), but about:</p>

<ul>
<li>API versioning</li>
<li>Functions, methods and classes signatures</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are working with a CI system such as Jenkins or Ansible, you could automatically deploy the library to a <a href=""https://docs.npmjs.com/private-modules/intro"" rel=""noreferrer"">private NPM account</a> (for JS and TS) or <a href=""https://inthecheesefactory.com/blog/how-to-setup-private-maven-repository/en"" rel=""noreferrer"">Maven server</a> (for Java and Kotlin).</p>

<p>I have the scenario about testing when the <code>request</code> is a <code>GET</code> and <code>Accept</code> is either <code>empty</code> or <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>It is closely related with:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48054312/getmapping-is-called-even-when-accept-is-defined-how-null"">@GetMapping is called even when Accept is defined how null</a></li>

<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14772634/what-does-accept-mean-under-client-section-of-request-headers"">What does 'Accept: <em>/</em>' mean under Client section of Request Headers?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Seems the following options how solutions are valid:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>400 Bad Request</code>  </li>
<li><code>406 Not Acceptable</code> </li>
<li>Consider the <code>empty</code> or <code>null</code> value of <code>Accept</code> how <code>*/*</code> instead</li>
</ol>

<p>Three options, that's the reason of this post.</p>

<p>Between the two first, I consider more appropriate <code>406 Not Acceptable</code>, it because it is <em>specific</em> or <em>tight</em> for <code>Accept</code>. I mean what media type represents <code>empty</code> or <code>null</code>? it is not a known media type such as <code>xml</code> or <code>json</code></p>

<p>The third option seems illogic, according with the following points (<em>according my own points of view, perhaps I am wrong or missing something</em>):</p>

<p>The <strong>server</strong> has a handler method for <code>GET</code> that returns either <code>XML</code> or <code>json</code>, such as:</p>

<pre><code>@GetMapping(path=""/{id}"",
            produces={MediaType.APPLICATION_XML_VALUE, MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_UTF8_VALUE})
public @ResponseBody Persona findOneById(@PathVariable String id){
    return personaService.findOneById(id);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>client</strong> <em>should have clear from the beginning</em> that it would do the <code>request</code> and handle the <code>response</code> either <code>XML</code> or <code>json</code>, according the <code>Accept</code> sent through the <code>request</code>. </p>

<p>Thus, for any reason if the <code>request</code> sent has the <code>Accept</code> how <code>empty</code> (lets assume <em>wrong coding</em>), It is the third point (<code>*/*</code>) that I can't understand: ""let the server return any media type""; even with that, lets assume the server returns <code>XML</code> and the client just can handle <code>JSON</code> instead, but of course that <code>Accept</code> how <code>Json</code> wasn't specified from the beginning. So the client once received the <code>response</code> should receive an exception, <em>but observe that the server did the work unnecessarily</em></p>

<p>Thus: How handle correctly HTTP Accept header when empty or null?</p>

<p>I want the demo to show the different error messages when the user clicks the submit button. For this is a demo form, I do not want the form to submit at all.</p>

<p>The error messages show up correctly (after pressing the submit button) when the field is empty (<code>required</code>-Validator) or e.g. 20,44 is entered (<code>tidDigits</code>-Validator). However, if a valid value is entered (e.g. 20,4), the form submits - i.e. the page is reloaded and the field name is appended to the URL: <code>/tid-form-row?temperatureName=20,4</code></p>

<p><strong>Is there any way to prevent a form from submitting at all?</strong></p>

<p>I tried <code>(ngSubmit)=""onSubmit()""</code> with <code>onSubmit() { return false; }</code> and also <code>(ngSubmit)=""$event.preventDefault()""</code> as stated <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40909585/angular-2-how-to-prevent-a-form-from-submitting-on-keypress-enter"">here</a>, but it did not work.

<p>The following code is faster than yours. Statistically I sample the majority of the days before the loop. The remaining days are sampled in the loop but the loop is likely to run only once. Maybe twice.</p>

<p>Moreover it is easy to rewrite with Rcpp.</p>

<pre><code>sample_r2= function(n = 12, min_dist = 5, seed = 42)
{
  available_days = seq(365)

  res = sort(sample(available_days, n))
  y = diff(res)
  res = res[y &gt;= min_dist]

  while (length(res) &lt; n)
  {
    forbidden_days = sapply(res, function(x){ x + -(min_dist-1):(min_dist-1) } )
    available_days = setdiff(available_days, forbidden_days)

    days = sample(available_days, n - length(res))
    res = sort(c(res, days))

    y = diff(res)
    res = res[y &gt;= min_dist]

  return(res)

The aim is still to combine them together, so creating one big table with the content of just three columns of the 20 tables. All the tables have different sizes, but they all have CODE, DESCRIPTION and PRICE, and these three columns should be grouped together and combined into a new table containing CODE, DESCRIPTION and PRICE of all the 20 tables (the tables are already preprocessed and do not contain duplicates, so I just need to combine them one on top of the other). </p>
