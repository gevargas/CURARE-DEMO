Your fonts.css:</p>

<pre><code>@font-face {
  font-family: 'a-icon';
  src: url('a-icon.eot');
  src:
    url('a-icon.ttf') format('truetype'),

    url('a-icon.svg') format('svg');
}
</code></pre>

<p>Second, include the file ""fonts.css"" in your styles.css of your angular application as follows: </p>

<pre><code>@import ""~a-icons/fonts.css"";

Beside the <code>GraphQLQueryResolver</code> which resolves the basic queries i also needed a <code>GraphQLResolver&lt;T&gt;</code> for my <code>Show</code>class, which looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>@Component
public class ShowResolver implements GraphQLResolver&lt;Show&gt; {
    @Autowired
    private CompetitionRepository competitionRepository;

    public List&lt;Competition&gt; competitions(Show show) {
        return ((List&lt;Competition&gt;)competitionRepository.findByShowId(show.getId()));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This tells the library how to resolve complex objects inside my <code>Show</code>class and is only used if the initially query requests to include the <code>Competition</code>objects. Happy new Year!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> As requested here is another solution using a custom execution strategy. I am using <code>graphql-spring-boot-starter</code> and <code>graphql-java-tools</code>:</p>

<p>I first define a GraphQL Config like this:</p>

<pre><code>@Configuration
public class GraphQLConfig {
    @Bean
    public Map&lt;String, ExecutionStrategy&gt; executionStrategies() {
        Map&lt;String, ExecutionStrategy&gt; executionStrategyMap = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
        executionStrategyMap.put(""queryExecutionStrategy"", new AsyncTransactionalExecutionStrategy());
        return executionStrategyMap;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>AsyncTransactionalExecutionStrategy</code> is defined like this:</p>

<pre><code>@Service
public class AsyncTransactionalExecutionStrategy extends AsyncExecutionStrategy {

    @Override
    @Transactional
    public CompletableFuture&lt;ExecutionResult&gt; execute(ExecutionContext executionContext, ExecutionStrategyParameters parameters) throws NonNullableFieldWasNullException {
        return super.execute(executionContext, parameters);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This puts the whole execution of the query inside the same transaction. I don't know if this is the most optimal solution, and it also already has some drawbacks in regards to error handling, but you don't need to define a type resolver that way.</p>

<p>I'm using firebase db to store text and firebase storage to store files. And here comes my issue.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: How to fetch a correct image <strong>from storage</strong> when fetching particular element <strong>from database</strong>?</p>

<p>Here's my attempt:</p>

<pre><code>const storageRef = firebase.storage().ref('companyImages/companyImage' + 123);
                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^ I dont have access to id yet :(
const task = storageRef.put(companyImage);

task.on('state_changed', () =&gt; {
  const percentage = (snap.bytesTransferred / snap.totalBytes) * 100; 
                               // ^^^^^^^^^^^^ not sure if i even need this
}, (err) =&gt; {
    console.log(err);
}, () =&gt; {
  firebase.database().ref('offers').push(values);
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ now I could retrieve id from it with .key but its too late
});
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, first what Im doing is uploading the image and when it's succesful, Im starting to upload the data to database. </p>

<p>Still, it doesnt work as it is supposed to. When uploading image I have to name it with a correct <code>id</code> to retrieve it easily later, in components. </p>

<p>It may look a lil bit complex but will appreciate any kind of help. Any suggestion or hint.</p>

<p><strong>Should I</strong> firstly upload data to DB and then image to the storage?</p>

Note you're using a immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) to switch from synchronous to asynchronous code, which is fine as long as you understand that <code>console.log('test2')</code> in your original code may not process in the same order as your code looks like it might. However, you did not call the IIFE, so simply add () to the end of it.</p>

<p>I.e., </p>

<pre><code>(function (){})();
(()=&gt;{})();
(async function(){})();
(async ()=&gt;{})();
</code></pre>

<p>As for the rest of your code, you don't resolve or reject your promise, return the promise correctly from the function, and you need to try{}catch{} your asynchronous function otherwise reject() from the promise will be unhandled. </p>

<pre><code>(function(){      
    let isAvailable = false;
    let asynchFunc = () =&gt; new Promise((resolve,reject) =&gt; {
        if (isAvailable === true) {

    });

        try{
            // isAvailable = true; // test with me.
            console.log('test1');
            // result is always true, unless there is an error.
            // but if there is an error 
            // the rejected promise will go to catch(e){}.
            let result = await asynchFunc();

            isAvailable = true;

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]

<p>I should add something like this (each Rewrite url for each category):</p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} (facebookexternalhit/[0-9]|Twitterbot|Pinterest|Google.*snippet)

Yes, at the app level you chose to make the whole thing a giant no-op for your microbenchmark, that's fine. But no, down beneath the covers at the system level, it's hardly ""nothing"". You asked linux to fork off a brand new execution environment, initialize it, and connect it to the environment. You called very few glibc functions, but dynamic linking is non-trivial and after a million instructions your process was ready to demand fault printf() and friends, and to efficiently bring in libs you might have linked against or dlopen()'ed.</p>

<p>This is not the sort of microbench that implementors are likely to optimize against. What <em>would</em> be of interest is if you can identify ""expensive"" aspects of fork/exec that in some use cases are never used, and so might be #ifdef'd out (or have their execution short circuited) in very specific situations. Lazy evaluation of resolv.conf is one example of that, where the overhead is never paid by a process if it never interacts with IP servers.</p>

Using Cooper's getRange arguments will likely reveal your problem, and will prevent you from having to update your row and column variables when you make changes to your code. Another issue that gets me sometimes is the fact that the setValues array needs to be exactly the same dimensions as the range. If one row has a different length, it will fail. If the logic I use to create row arrays can result in different lengths, I use the function below to make sure my arrays are symmetric before writing them to a sheet. It is also helpful for debugging.</p>

I can run the commands just fine in powershell, but I wanted to automate the entire thing through one batch script:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Keep the windows 10 privacy settings script up to date. This is done through the following command in powershell:</p>

</ol>

<p>Just need to make sure that the destination folder for download is set first (I have no idea how to do this through a batchfile/script). The command comes from the script that someone wrote on github located <a href=""https://github.com/hahndorf/Set-Privacy/blob/master/README.md"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a></p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li><p>Run the powershell script to turn privacy settings off, on the highest setting. This is done through the following command, again from the link above:</p>

<pre><code>.\Set-Privacy.ps1 -Strong -admin
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Remove background apps, for example, removing ""3D Builder"":</p></li>

<pre><code>get-appxpackage *3dbuilder* | remove-appxpackage

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/46796879/7579632"">Create a button that accepts .PNG images as Glyph</a></p>

<p>the first class to be exact it is a <code>TPersistent</code> that exposed the Glyph coordinates in the <code>TNCRSpeedButton</code>. </p>

<p>I'm writing this because I said <strong><em>I hope you benefit well from it.</em></strong> and I can see you did not.</p>

<p>So this is your solution to your problem and you are more than welcome to ask any thing about how it is implemented.</p>

Then push all your uploadedfileDownloadURL's into an object or array and then store that into your database. So in the future you can access this object or array from, lets say your user/ProfilePHotos, and then in your app level code you can just use the DownloadURL as a uri links inside an image tag!</p>

<p>In this example I am using react-native, I upload multiple photos, save the download URL each time in an array, then set the array to firebase under the users account. </p>

<pre><code>export const userVehiclePhotoUploadRequest = (photos, user, year) =&gt; dispatch =&gt; {
    console.log('Inside vehiclePhotoUpload Actions', photos, user)

    let referenceToUploadedPhotos = [];

    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
        photos.map(ele =&gt; {
            let mime = 'application/octet-stream'

            let uri = ele.uri
            let uploadUri = Platform.OS === 'ios' ? uri.replace('file://', '') : uri
            let sessionId = new Date().getTime()
            let uploadBlob = null
            let imageRef = firebase.storage().ref('vehicleImages/' + `${user.account.uid}`).child(`${sessionId}`)

            fs.readFile(uploadUri, 'base64')
                .then((data) =&gt; {
                    return Blob.build(data, { type: `${mime};BASE64` })
                })
                .then((blob) =&gt; {
                    uploadBlob = blob
                    return imageRef.put(blob, { contentType: mime })
                })
                .then(() =&gt; {
                    uploadBlob.close()
                    return imageRef.getDownloadURL()
                })
                .then((url) =&gt; {
                    referenceToUploadedPhotos.push(url)
                    console.log('ARRAY OF URLS WHILE PUSHING', referenceToUploadedPhotos)

        .then(() =&gt; {
            //I did this to not go home until photos are done uploading.
